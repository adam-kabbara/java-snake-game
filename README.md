# Snake Game

Just a basic snake game written in java using the ```swing``` library

## Hierarchy
This game is made up of several classes. First, we have the most basic class, ```Cube.java```. This class is essentially just draws a square on the screen. Then we have the ```Snake.java``` class. This class groups several ```Cube``` objects in an ```ArrayList```and implements basic logic for movement and collision of the snake. Finally, we have the ```snakeGame.java``` class. This class puts everything together and implements a simple high score system while saving a high score to a ```.txt``` file. This class also contains the main game loop and it implements collision logic with the borders of the window...
